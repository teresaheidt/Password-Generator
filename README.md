## What it is
The password generator generates a password based on the user criteria.

## The Goal
My goal was to create a secure and user friendly password generator, that contains numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and special characters.

# The steps
The Steps to securing the Password:

* The user will click the user button to generate the password.

* Then a prompt will apear asking the user how many characters
The user must type in any number between 8 and 128 characters in length. 

*NOTE: When the user types in a number outside of the given range, a prompt will appear telling the user to use 'More numbers please!' or 'Less numbers please!'* 

* When the number is input within the range, the prompt box will appear asking if the user wold like to use an uppercase number.

* The next prompt will be if the user would like to use a lowercase number.

* The final prompt is asking if the user woul like to use a special character.

**If all of these prompts are met, a generated password will appear in the box**
